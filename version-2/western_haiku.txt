Snow in my shoe abandoned sparrowâ€™s nest
Whitecaps on the bay: A broken signboard banging in the April wind.
Lily: out of the water out of itself
Bass picking bugs off the moon
Quail excited in dirt turned up by a gopher
Ground squirrel balancing its tomato on the garden fence
Just friends: he watches my gauze dress blowing on the line
A little boy sings on a terrace, eyes aglow
