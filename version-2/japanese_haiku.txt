Autumn moonlight – a worm digs silently into the chestnut.
Old pond a frog jumps the sound of water.
Autumn wind – mountain’s shadow wavers.
Don’t weep, insects – lovers, stars themselves, must part
In the coolness of the empty sixth-month sky... the cuckoo’s cry.
The tree cut, dawn breaks early at my little window
